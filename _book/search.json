    "text": "Preface\nWelcome to the Course: Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling\nHave you ever wondered how medications travel through the human body, or how we determine the right dose for each patient? Understanding drug movement and action isn’t just for pharmacologists—it’s a key competency in modern healthcare and biomedical research.\nThis course invites you to explore the fascinating world of pharmacokinetics (PK)—how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolised, and excreted—and pharmacodynamics (PD)—how drugs produce their effects. You’ll gain practical insights into the models that help us simulate and predict drug behavior in the body, from simple compartment models to advanced physiologically based models used in cutting-edge research and clinical decision-making.\n\n\nThrough interactive content and hands-on examples, you’ll learn how PK/PD modelling plays a critical role in: - Understanding variability in patient responses - Optimising drug dosing - Evaluating drug-drug interactions\nBuilt with open technologies and aligned with best practices in digital health education, this course empowers you to become part of a growing community of learners and educators who believe in transparency, reproducibility, and innovation.\nReady to begin? Dive in and transform the way you think about medicine.",

    "text": "1.1 General idea\nThis open, practice-oriented course introduces the fundamentals of pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modelling, with a strong emphasis on reproducible research, open science, and digital competencies in health professions education. Leveraging best practices from software development—such as version control via Git and GitHub, continuous integration (CI) for automated course building, and open formats like Markdown—the course is designed as a fully open educational resource. Hosted on the Open edX platform, it combines theoretical foundations with interactive, hands-on learning to equip participants with the skills needed to understand, simulate, and critically assess PK/PD models in clinical and research contexts.\nThe course consists of the following complementary parts which should allow as much offline studying as possible:",

The pharmacokinetic modelling course covers topics such as pharmacokinetic principles, drug distribution, clearance and elimination and the factors that influence these processes. Students will learn about different models used to describe pharmacokinetics, such as compartmental models and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, and how these models can be used to predict drug concentrations and optimise dosing regimens. Other topics that may be covered include pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions and the use of pharmacokinetic modelling in drug development and clinical practice. Overall, a course in pharmacokinetic modelling will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques used to describe the movement of drugs through the body and how this knowledge can be applied to improve drug therapy.
