## Open edX
Open edX is a thriving open source project, backed by a great community, for running an online learning platform at scale. Open edX comes with an LMS (Learning Management System) where students access course contents, a CMS (Content Management System) that course staff uses to design courses, and a few other components to provide more services to students, course staff, and platform administrators.

A local installation of OpenEdx can be setup with tutor: <https://docs.tutor.edly.io/index.html>. This requires a working docker installation: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
tutor local launch
```
This results in 
```bash
All services initialised.
The platform is now running and can be accessed at the following urls:

    http://local.openedx.io
    http://studio.local.openedx.io
    http://meilisearch.local.openedx.io
    http://apps.local.openedx.io
```

### Creating a new user with staff and admin rights
You will most certainly need to create a user to administer the platform. Just run:
```bash
tutor local do createuser --staff --superuser matthiaskoenig konigmatt@googlemail.com
```

### Importing the demo course
After a fresh installation, your platform will not have a single course. To import the Open edX demo course, run:
```bash
tutor local do importdemocourse
```

### Status
You can view your platformâ€™s containers:
```bash
tutor local status
```
