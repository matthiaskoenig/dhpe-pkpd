# Course pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling
This repository contains the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling course of the [König Systems Medicine of Liver Lab](https://livermetabolism.com). 
The project was developed as a teaching project as part of the Digital Health Professions Educator Program ah the Charité Berlin in 2024-2025.

## Course concept
The course 

## Course content
Pharmacokinetic modelling is the study of how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolised and excreted in the body. The pharmacokinetic modelling course covers topics such as pharmacokinetic principles, drug distribution, clearance and elimination and the factors that influence these processes. Students will learn about different models used to describe pharmacokinetics, such as compartmental models and physiologically based pharmacokinetic models, and how these models can be used to predict drug concentrations and optimise dosing regimens. Other topics that may be covered include pharmacodynamics, drug-drug interactions and the use of pharmacokinetic modelling in drug development and clinical practice. Overall, a course in pharmacokinetic modelling will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques used to describe the movement of drugs through the body and how this knowledge can be applied to improve drug therapy.
