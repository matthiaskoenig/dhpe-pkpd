Welcome to the Course: **Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling**

Have you ever wondered how medications travel through the human body, or how we determine the right dose for each patient? Understanding drug movement and action isn’t just for pharmacologists—it’s a key competency in modern healthcare and biomedical research.

This course invites you to explore the fascinating world of **pharmacokinetics (PK)**—how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolised, and excreted—and **pharmacodynamics (PD)**—how drugs produce their effects. You'll gain practical insights into the models that help us simulate and predict drug behavior in the body, from simple compartment models to advanced physiologically based models used in cutting-edge research and clinical decision-making.

Through interactive content and hands-on examples, you'll learn how PK/PD modelling plays a critical role in:

- Understanding variability in patient responses
- Optimising drug dosing
- Evaluating drug-drug interactions



Built with open technologies and aligned with best practices in digital health education, this course empowers you to become part of a growing community of learners and educators who believe in transparency, reproducibility, and innovation.
