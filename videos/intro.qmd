Hey there!

Have you ever wondered how medications actually work in the body?  
How they’re absorbed, where they go, how they’re broken down, and why the same drug can affect people so differently?

💊 Welcome to Pharmacokinetic & Pharmacodynamic Modelling – your gateway into the science of how drugs move and act in the body.

👨‍🏫 I’m Matthias König, and I’ll be your guide throughout this course.  
Together, we’ll explore the fascinating world of PK/PD through:

- Clear, hands-on lessons  
- Interactive scenarios  
- And open tools that make learning both fun and reproducible

✨ Built with open technologies like Markdown, and hosted on Open edX and GitHub, this course is all about learning by doing.

No boring lectures. Just science, models, and playful experimentation.  
Join us and become part of the future of digital health education!
